# 🚀 My First GitHub Repo

Hey there! 👋  
This is my very first GitHub repository. I'm just starting my journey into the world of coding, version control, and open-source contribution — and this is where it all begins!

## 📌 What's inside?

- Basic files I’m using to learn Git and GitHub
- Experiments with commits, branches, and README editing
- Notes and learnings along the way

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Mostly just **C**, maybe some **HTML**, **Python**, or whatever I’m currently learning!

## 💡 Why this repo?

I wanted a space to:
- Try out Git commands
- Understand how repositories work
- Track my growth as a developer

## 🌱 What’s next?

- More projects coming soon!
- Cleaner code, better READMEs, and cooler ideas!
